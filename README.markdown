h1. Using Unittest 2

Write your tests in tests.py. For each new behavior you're testing
write a seperate class that derives from unittest.TestCase. Then
read more here: http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html

To run the tests from the command line type python test.py or
if on a *nix variant run ./tests.py (provided python is in /usr/bin)
